        <p>Hi! my name is Jake! I am a newlywed, and I have a beautiful wife, and her name is Amanda. We both have a dog, a piece that we got before we got married.  Her dog is a cattle dog named Rooney, named after Wayne Rooney, and my dog is a German Shepard Border Collie mix, and his name is Sebastian Winston III. They love to go to the beach and chase after balls. They are both amazing snugglers; even though Rooney acts as if he hates it, he secretly loves it.</p>
        <p>I recently retired from playing professional soccer.  I played competitive soccer for almost 24 years before deciding that I wanted a new challenge in my life.  My career as a soccer player was gratifying.  I was extremely fortunate that I got to travel worldwide and the United States to play the game I loved.  However, I am ready for a new challenge.  I've always been intrigued by tech and have enjoyed developing websites in the past, and have finally decided to take the plunge in learning more about web development.  When I retired, my main goal when choosing my next venture was to choose something where I had to learn a new skill and be just as challenged as my former profession.  I'm excited to start this adventure of becoming a web developer.  </p>
